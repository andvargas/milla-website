            <p>Iâ€™m a Hungarian-Transylvanian artist, I use a wide variety of mediums, subject matters, techniques and styles. I have been learning from artists who share their skills via youtube and other online platforms. I love experimenting, expressing my thoughts, feelings, ideas, dreams through painting and drawing. I like exploring philosophical topics, symbols, and I usually hide a message behind my compositions.</p>
